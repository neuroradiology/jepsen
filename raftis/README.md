# Raftis Jepsen Test

A Clojure library designed to test [Raftis](https://github.com/Qihoo360/floyd/tree/master/floyd/example/redis), a Redis protocol raft cluster implemented by [Floyd](https://github.com/Qihoo360/floyd).

## What is Raftis

Raftis = Raft + Redis protocol

Raftis support redis's kv interface for now. We implement the redis protocol consistent system with Floyd, a library that could be easily embeded into users' application. Raftis is just like zookeeper, etcd.
